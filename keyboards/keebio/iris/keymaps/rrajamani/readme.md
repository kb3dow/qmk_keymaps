# KeebIO Iris split keyboard
===

A split keyboard with mapping taken from my layout of infinity60 so that both are similar.

Hardware Supported: Iris
Hardware Availability: KeebIO

Make example for this keyboard (after setting up your build environment):

    qmk -kb keebio/iris/rev2 -km rrajamani  

    qmk flash -kb keebio/iris/rev2 -km rrajamani
